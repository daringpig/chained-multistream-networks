Here you can find our demo code for creating 3-channel input flow to the network. 
Please note that here we provided the brox method but in the paper, results are reported based on the TVL1 method. 
TVL1 code is available at https://github.com/yjxiong/dense_flow
then use similar approach to convert flow components into a 3-channel rgb image.
