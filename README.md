# chained-multistream-networks
Code and models of paper " Chained Multi-stream Networks Exploiting Pose, Motion, and Appearance for Action Classification and Detection" in ICCV 2017

TODO:
- Network and models
- Add pre-trained models
- Add documentation regarding input modalities; RGB, Flow, Pose

   *Pose: network and models
   *flow: Brox method and tvl-1
- Scripts for evaluations and creating pose data.
- Data lists
- JHMDB21 dataset and models for download.
